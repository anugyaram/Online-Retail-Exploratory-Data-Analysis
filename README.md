# Online-Retail-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Case Study
In this project, I will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. I have explored and analyzed this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. 

By conducting exploratory data analysis, I have identified patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, which allowed me to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I uncovered key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, the project aim is to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.
